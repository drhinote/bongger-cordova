      <p>
        You can get some Bongger directly from other Bongger users by giving out an address generated on the 'Receive' tab. Or by purchasing the coin at:
        <br>
        <br>
        <u style="font-size: 32px">
          <a href="https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=drhinote" target="_blank">Cryptopia</a>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>You can use the above exchange to convert your Bongger coins back to a fiat currency such as the US dollar as well. (But why would you want to do something crazy like that???)</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">The most experimental crytocurrency in the world! </p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">Welcome to Bongger :) Bongger was first released in April of 2014 (around 4/20, heh...). Since then, it has been regarded as an underdog, but it has remained as stable and useful as it's progenetors: Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin. Bongger is an deflationary
        currency that will over time continue to increase in value as there is only a limited supply of the coin. The total coin supply is set at 504,000,000. The first 84,000,000 were reserved for promotions &amp; payment for development work. The remaining
        420,000,000 coins are currently being generated as subsidies for the miners that process the transactions sent to and from the users of Bongger.</p>
